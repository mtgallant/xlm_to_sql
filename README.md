# xlm_to_sql
Conversion of certain research datasets from xml to sql.  After working with the generic_parser (https://github.com/cns-iu/generic_parser/edit/master/README.md), I found some issues that made working with it tough.  There were several datasets I needed to parse and I needed a better tool to reduce the debug cycle.
